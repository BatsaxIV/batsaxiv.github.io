title: Akeneo | The old grey hare, 1.7 is here!
category: akeneo
---

*Praised this new Akeneo's version, labelled [The Old Grey Hare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Grey_Hare), and its brand new features!*

# Teamwork Assistant (EE only)

Before this tool, you only had a macro view of your catalog completeness, on the dashboard by channels and also by filtering the product list with the completeness information.  
Now, by selecting a locale, scope, category and product filters you create a *project* that will be shown on the dashboard of the releveant users.

This can be a great tool for following your catalog enrichment.

# Web API (CE & EE)

As a developer, I was waiting this feature for a long time and some clients, also, were in need of this.  
Long story short, you can **CRUD on every entity** (product, category, family, attribute...)!

# Improvements

*"Stay with me my friend, they are finally here" said Elmer, referencing the first three items on the following list*.

As always, a bunch of small improvements come with this new version:

* When you select a filter in a multi-select, the default *ALL* is removed. Damn, I was so happy to removed it manually **EVERY TIME** !
* Default element's number for all list is now **25**
* Job execution list shows the number of warning
* Completeness attribute are highlighted = time saved!
* You can add an entire attribute group in a family, this is quite useful.
* You can share views across users.

Don't forget that you can quickly test all the CE features on their [demo website](http://demo.akeneo.com/).

# Migrating

The [upgrade doc](https://github.com/akeneo/pim-community-dev/blob/master/UPGRADE-1.7.md) with 10 steps looks quite easy ; as always, pay a special attention to the [Migrate your custom code](https://github.com/akeneo/pim-community-dev/blob/master/UPGRADE-1.7.md#migrate-your-custom-code) part.  
Don't forget this a **major** version, don't rush this migration (for more information on why akeneo does not follow semantic versionning *yet* see [here](https://github.com/akeneo/pim-community-dev/issues/3261))  



*You can find more informations on the [official release notes](https://www.akeneo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Akeneo-Release-Notes-1.7-EN.pdf)*.
